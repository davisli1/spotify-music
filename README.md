# Bringing Data into Music

Hello everyone, its time to incorporate my music passion into some data science. As someone who wants to eventually start or invest in a record label, I wanted to analysis Spotify music data to see what type of trends there are. In addition, I want to see what "makes a song popular."

My process will be:
1. Cleaning Data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Answering Initial Hypothesis)
3. Data Preperation (Feature engineering)
4. Implementing Machine Learning Models
5. Cross-Validation
6. Deploying Model (If I have the time)
