# Bringing Data into Music

Hello everyone, its time to incorporate my music passion into some data science. As someone who wants to eventually start or invest in a record label, I wanted to analysis Spotify music data to see what type of trends there are. In addition, I want to see what "makes a song popular."

My process will be:
1. Cleaning Data
2. Creating Initial Set of Hypothesis to Explore
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Answering Initial Hypothesis)
4. Written Report to Incorporate Other Variables
